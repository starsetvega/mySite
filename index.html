            Hello, this is my website! Thank you for visiting, now allow me to talk about myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am an American who lives in Washington. I started studying medicine at college but never finished the course. I am obsessed with jazz. Physically, I am in pretty good shape. I am average-height with fair skin. I grew up in a working class neighbourhood. My parents separated when I was small, but remained friends and provided a happy, stable home. I am currently in a relationship with Mandy. Mandy is the same age as me and works as an artist. My best friend is a health centre receptionist named Norman. We get on well most of the time. I also hang around with Faye and Derrick. They enjoy relaxing together.

            I'm frank, dauntless and brave. This is to be expected from somebody with his shocking past. I was born and grew up in a small family in a normal city, and lived free of trouble until I was about 6 years old, but at that point life took a turn for the worst.

            I lost my best friend in an epidemic and was rejected by all. With a childhood friend I had to survive in a bitter world. But with my fighting skills and capability, I managed to crush all that was in the way and keep ahead of the curve. This has turned me into the man I am today.

            Having finally found some peace of mind, I now work as help for hire. By doing so, I hope to leave the past behind and finally find the pleasureful life I have never had.

            I have always loved art and programming. I find myself always being drawn to modeling and animating my own characters. I also enjoy learning to play the piano, and every Christmas I aim to bring some jingle joy to my family and loved ones. I always enjoying entertaining those around me.
